## Variables

Predefined Workdays type for the US work week\. Mon\-Fri are marked true\.

```go
var USWorkDays = Workdays{true, true, true, true, true, false, false}
```

## type [BitCal](<https://github.com/cxtuttle/go-bitcal/bitcal.go#L19-L23>)

```go
type BitCal struct {
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

### func [Create](<https://github.com/cxtuttle/go-bitcal/bitcal.go#L45>)

```go
func Create(wd Workdays, hd Holidays) (c *BitCal)
```

Create takes a Workday and Holidays struct and returns an initialized struct in return that can be used for calls against that Calendar\.

### func \(\*BitCal\) [AddWorkDays](<https://github.com/cxtuttle/go-bitcal/bitcal.go#L393>)

```go
func (c *BitCal) AddWorkDays(date time.Time, days int) (ret_date time.Time)
```

AddWorkDays take a starting time\.Time and the number of work days\( positive or negative \) to add to the date\.  A time\.Time is returned\.

### func \(\*BitCal\) [DeltaWorkDays](<https://github.com/cxtuttle/go-bitcal/bitcal.go#L476>)

```go
func (c *BitCal) DeltaWorkDays(date1 time.Time, date2 time.Time) (days int)
```

DeltaWorkDays takes two time\.Time's and returns the number of work days between them\.

## type [Holidays](<https://github.com/cxtuttle/go-bitcal/bitcal.go#L37-L39>)

TODO: The Holidays type will eventually add holiday support\. The dates here will be omitted from a work calendar\.  Expect type to change\.

```go
type Holidays struct {
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

## type [Workdays](<https://github.com/cxtuttle/go-bitcal/bitcal.go#L26-L34>)

Workdays type is used to assign whether a given day is a workday\. Assign true to a day to indicate it is a workday\.

```go
type Workdays struct {
    Mon bool
    Tue bool
    Wed bool
    Thu bool
    Fri bool
    Sat bool
    Sun bool
}
```
